# Profitable-App-Profiles-for-the-App-Store-and-Google-Play-Markets
Aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets and enable team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.


Step 1: Exploring Data
Step 2: Data Cleaning
        * Removing duplicate entries and getting rid of errors.
        * Filtering free apps as most of the data revenue has to be studied from the in-app purchases.
        * Filtering out non-english apps.
Step 3: Determine the kinds of apps that are likely to attract more users because our revenue is highly influenced by the number of people using our apps.
